  Whilst doing my MSc in Healthcare Ethics & Law, I realised my work is based on pre-empting situations before they occur and what implications they will have on people, communities and society at large. I decided to solve problems using data-led solutions. I focus on maximising impact and flag risk-factors in my solutions. My holistic understanding of a dataset enables me to create models which can easily be applied in real life. I love being able to use data analysis to create optimal strategies.
